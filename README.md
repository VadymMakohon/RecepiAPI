# Simple Recipe API

A Simple yet cool Recipe API built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to view various recipes, including detailed descriptions, ingredients, and instructions. It also supports a "View more" feature that stores selected recipe details in session storage for later viewing.

## Features

- Browse Recipes: Explore a list of recipes with their basic details.
- View Recipe: Click on a recipe to view its image, description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
- Session Storage: When you click the "View more" hyperlink, the recipe information is saved to the browser's session storage so you can view detailed recipe information on a new page.
- Responsive Design: The project uses responsive web design techniques to ensure it works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
